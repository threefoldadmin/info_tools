# Basic Tutorials
These tutorial are dedicated to the tools used by a Company 3.0

We recommend to keep all documents in GIT, which is a document version control system.
This will make all team collaboration transparent and efficient.

Initially these tools were created by engineers for engineers, but now we realize how powerful they are for many other use cases.

If you want to be part of a company 3.0, you will have to familiarize yourself with all necessary tools.
