# Task-management with GOGs 
We use GOGs (self-hosted git) for keeping source codes, documentation and as a project management tool.

As the first step, please check definitions:
* [Project](https://docs.greenitglobe.com/teal.university/whatis/src/master/teal_definitions.md#project)
* [Milestone](https://docs.greenitglobe.com/teal.university/whatis/src/master/teal_definitions.md#milestone)

Each project (represented by a repository in GOGs) have list of issues.
1. Any team member can create issues. Tasks to be done, bugs, problems, discussions. 
2. Issues can be grouped in Milestones.
3. Issues can be assigned to someone.
4. Issues can have labels to simplify filetering and distingusing. 

## Issues

When you open repository, in top menu there is an 'Issues' section.
